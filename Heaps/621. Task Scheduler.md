### [621. Task Scheduler](https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/)

Given a characters array  `tasks`, representing the tasks a CPU needs to do, where each letter represents a different task. Tasks could be done in any order. Each task is done in one unit of time. For each unit of time, the CPU could complete either one task or just be idle.

However, there is a non-negative integer `n`  that represents the cooldown period between two  **same tasks** (the same letter in the array), that is that there must be at least  `n`  units of time between any two same tasks.

Return  _the least number of units of times that the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2 </br>
**Output:** 8 </br>
**Explanation:** 
A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B
There is at least 2 units of time between any two same tasks.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 0 </br>
**Output:** 6 </br>
**Explanation:** On this case any permutation of size 6 would work since n = 0. 
["A","A","A","B","B","B"]
["A","B","A","B","A","B"]
["B","B","B","A","A","A"]
...
And so on.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** tasks = ["A","A","A","A","A","A","B","C","D","E","F","G"], n = 2 </br>
**Output:** 16 </br>
**Explanation:** 
One possible solution is
A -> B -> C -> A -> D -> E -> A -> F -> G -> A -> idle -> idle -> A -> idle -> idle -> A

**Example 4:**

**Input:** tasks = ["A","A"], n = 2 </br>
**Output:** 4
</br></br>
**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= task.length <= 10^4`
-   `tasks[i]`  is upper-case English letter.
-   The integer  `n`  is in the range  `[0, 100]`.

### Solution:

#### Failed try (WA):
Doesn't pass all cases.
```py
class Solution:
    def leastInterval(self, tasks: List[str], n: int) -> int:
        # map: tracks all tasks last index
        freq_count, cnt, map, res = Counter(tasks), len(tasks), {}, -1
        while cnt > 0:
            for task in set(tasks):
                if task in freq_count and freq_count[task] == 0:
                    del freq_count[task]
                elif task not in freq_count:
                    pass
                else:
                    freq_count[task] -= 1
                    cnt -= 1
                    if task not in map or res-map[task] >= n:
                        res += 1
                    else:
                        if res == 0:
                            res += n+1
                        else:
                            res += n
                    map[task] = res
        return res+1
```

#### MaxHeap Approach:

```py
class Solution:
    def leastInterval(self, tasks: List[str], n: int) -> int:
        # Create max-heap (min_heap with all elements negative) for finishing most frequent tasks first to avoid interval time
        heap, time = [], 0
        freq_count = Counter(tasks)
        # Create a Queue to pop off tasks and push to heap whenever the time is available for them
        queue = deque()

        for count in freq_count.values():
            heapq.heappush(heap, -count)

        while heap or queue:
            task = heapq.heappop(heap)
            task += 1
            time += 1
            if task != 0:
                queue.append([task, time+n])
            if queue and not heap:
                time = queue[0][1]
            if queue and queue[0][1] == time:
                popped = queue.popleft()
                heapq.heappush(heap, popped[0])
        return time
```

#### Same MaxHeap Approach (little diff. way)

```py
class Solution:
    def leastInterval(self, tasks: List[str], n: int) -> int:
        freq_count = Counter(tasks)
        # Create max-heap (min_heap with all elements negative) for finishing most frequent tasks first to avoid interval time
        heap = [-count for count in freq_count.values()]
        heapq.heapify(heap)
        time = 0
        # Create a Queue to pop off tasks and push to heap whenever the time is available for them
        queue = deque()

        while heap or queue:
            time += 1
            if heap:
                cnt = 1 + heapq.heappop(heap)
                # append to queue if cnt is not zero.
                if cnt:
                    queue.append([cnt, time + n])
            if queue and queue[0][1] == time:
                heapq.heappush(heap, queue.popleft()[0])
        return time
```


### Analysis

  
The time complexity of the `leastInterval` function can be analyzed as follows:

1.  **Counting Frequency**:
    
    -   Counting the frequency of each task using `Counter(tasks)` takes O(n) time, where n is the number of tasks.
2.  **Creating the Heap**:
    
    -   Creating a heap of negative frequencies (`heap = [-count for count in freq_count.values()]`) takes O(n) time, where n is the number of unique tasks.
    -   Heapifying the heap using `heapq.heapify(heap)` takes O(n) time.
3.  **Main Loop**:
    
    -   The main loop iterates until both the heap and the queue are empty.
    -   In each iteration, there are two primary operations:
        -   Popping from the heap: This operation takes O(log n) time.
        -   Popping from the queue: This operation takes O(1) time.
4.  **Overall Time Complexity**:
    
    -   The overall time complexity of the main loop depends on the number of tasks and the value of n.
    -   Since each task is pushed and popped at most once from both the heap and the queue, the total number of operations inside the loop is proportional to the number of tasks, which is O(n).
    -   Therefore, the time complexity of the main loop is O(n * log n) because the heap operations dominate the time complexity.

So, the overall time complexity of the `leastInterval` function is `O(n * log n)`. It efficiently calculates the minimum intervals required to execute all tasks while considering the cooling period (n).
