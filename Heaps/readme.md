[Original Post](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/1127238/master-heap-understanding-4-patterns-where-heap-data-structure-is-used)

Different questions where HEAP is common data structure to use can be categorized in following 4 categories:

-   Top K Pattern
-   Merge K Sorted Pattern
-   Two Heaps Pattern
-   Minimum Number Pattern


All questions under one patterns has some similarities in terms of using HEAP as a data structure. Completing these questions would gurantee you mastery on the HEAP data structure. Below list includes some of the most common questions asked in most of the companies.
