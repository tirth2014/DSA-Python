## Backtracking problem patterns

Backtracking is a powerful algorithmic technique used to solve problems by systematically trying out different choices and undoing those choices if they lead to a dead end. Here are some common backtracking problem patterns you might encounter on LeetCode:

1. **Subset Generation:**
   - Generating all subsets of a given set.
   - Problems: Subsets, Subsets II, Combination Sum, Combination Sum II.

2. **Permutation Generation:**
   - Generating all permutations of a given set of elements.
   - Problems: Permutations, Permutations II, Next Permutation, Letter Combinations of a Phone Number.

3. **Combination Generation:**
   - Generating combinations of elements from a given set.
   - Problems: Combinations, Combinations Sum III, Combination Sum IV.

4. **N-Queens:**
   - Placing N queens on an NxN chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.
   - Problems: N-Queens, N-Queens II.

5. **Sudoku Solving:**
   - Filling a partially filled Sudoku grid while adhering to the rules of Sudoku.
   - Problems: Sudoku Solver.

6. **Word Search:**
   - Searching for a given word in a grid of letters.
   - Problems: Word Search, Word Search II.

7. **Graph Coloring:**
   - Coloring the nodes of a graph such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color.
   - Problems: Graph Valid Tree, N-ary Tree Level Order Traversal.

8. **Palindrome Partitioning:**
   - Breaking a string into substrings such that each substring is a palindrome.
   - Problems: Palindrome Partitioning, Palindrome Partitioning II.

9. **Expression Evaluation:**
   - Evaluating arithmetic expressions with operators and operands.
   - Problems: Basic Calculator, Basic Calculator II.

10. **Cryptography and Cryptarithmetic:**
   - Solving puzzles where letters are replaced with digits in an arithmetic equation.
   - Problems: Cryptarithmetic Puzzle, Word Search II.

11. **Robot Movements:**
   - Finding paths for a robot moving in a grid to reach a certain destination.
   - Problems: Unique Paths, Unique Paths II.

12. **Satisfiability and Validity:**
    - Checking whether a given configuration satisfies certain constraints or rules.
    - Problems: Satisfiability of Equality Equations, Valid Sudoku.

Remember that each backtracking problem has its unique characteristics, but understanding these patterns can help you approach these problems more effectively. It's essential to practice and get familiar with different backtracking scenarios to improve your problem-solving skills.
