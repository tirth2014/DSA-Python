# [860. Lemonade Change](https://leetcode.com/problems/lemonade-change/)

At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs  `$5`. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills). Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a  `$5`,  `$10`, or  `$20`  bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction is that the customer pays  `$5`.

Note that you do not have any change in hand at first.

Given an integer array  `bills`  where  `bills[i]`  is the bill the  `ith`  customer pays, return  `true`  _if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or_  `false`  _otherwise_.

## **Example 1:**

### **Input:**
bills = [5,5,5,10,20]
### **Output:** 
true
### **Explanation:** 
From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.
From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.
From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.
Since all customers got correct change, we output true.

## Solution:

```py
class Solution:
    def lemonadeChange(self, bills: List[int]) -> bool:
        # 0th index for 5$, 1st for 10$ and 2nd for 20$
        map_idx = {0: 5, 1: 10, 2: 20}
        map_amt = {5 : 0, 10 : 1, 20 : 2}
        available = [0] * 3
        for bill in bills:
            rem_bill = bill - map_idx[0]
            if rem_bill != 0:
                # Check if we can return the correct change to customer
                # Using greedy approach. (Return maximum possible amount first in this case)
                for i in range(len(available)-1, -1, -1):
                    while map_idx[i] <= rem_bill and available[i] > 0:
                        available[i] -= 1
                        rem_bill -= map_idx[i]
            if rem_bill == 0:
                available[map_amt[bill]] += 1
            else:
                return False
        return True
```
